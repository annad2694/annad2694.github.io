            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <h3> Context</h3>
            <p>In my Software Engineering Class, the students had an objective to create a project. They were to create an original movie and use their knowledge of CSS and HTML 
            to make a webpage to advertise said movie. My partner and I decided to continue the series of The Maze Runner by making a fourth and fifth movie. It is called "The Kill 
            Order" and "The Fever Code" with similar characters but completely different stories. </p>
            <h3> Content </h3>
            <p>The world is in a haze from the global warming of the sun, and those who haven't already been killed by the heat are instead killed by a disease that spreads by contact.
            This apocalypse and climate issue have reached internationally. However, this group—the new generation, the ones immune to the disease and who can withstand the heat of the 
            sun—adventure out to destroy the evil organization that had created all of this in the first place. From their previous journeys in the other movies, the group thinks they are 
            finished with the organization WICKED once and for all, but little did they know that those they've left behind will make an appearance again; this time, they'll be on the opposing
            side, making WICKED possible once again. Since then, it seems that history repeats again. And the only way to take WICKED down once again is to start at the very beginning, with the maze 
            and the runners.</p>
            
           <h3> Reflections</h3>
            
            <h4> Challanges </h4>
            
          <p> My partner and I really wanted our project to have the look of an article. The article format typically would have the image on the left or the right side and have the words right next to that. 
            When we put the image and typed our paragraph, we realized that the text didn't align with how we imagined it to. The image didn't take up a lot of space, but there was still a lot of blank space next 
            to it, and the words ended up going below it. Mr. Mueller, our teacher, told us some time before that we could use the text-align property to fix this issue and make both images and sentences go in 
            separate directions. Although this did not work for us. So I asked for his help, and after some time he experimented and decided the float property was the best option for us. It did the job, but I 
            and my partner were still unhappy with how our webpage looked. There was this awkward space between the ends of the digital paper and absolutely no space between the sentences and the image, almost as 
            if they were overlapping. My partner then finally came up with a solution; by adding margins, padding, divs, and borders, she managed to make the words more distanced from the image and make everything 
            proportional on the page. From there we applied the same concept to the sequel we made, and the webpage turned out great. I was still confused about how she managed to do all that and asked her to explain 
            it to me. Once she explained it to me, I was proficient in all of those elements listed, and I decided to make one border of two different colors by using the style property and setting it to outset. After that,
            we agreed that our webpage looked absolutely exceptional with the extra fine details. </p>  
            <h4> Takeaways </h4>
            <p> I learned new things about CSS and HTML that I wasn't aware of before, and that is thanks to the community I'm surrounded with. But the biggest takeaway I have is that collaboration is key when working in a partnership 
            or group. I am grateful that my partner was a friend of mine, but it was still challenging to work on the project together because she had no social media where we could interact with each other after school. We in person 
            told each other what time we would be online and working on the project so we could communicate there or the lovely online chatting place called Slack provided by our teacher to help send each other links that we needed 
            to visit or just to discuss issues about the project that we didn't get to talk about while working on it in class. Thus, all this communication we have done has led to collaboratively working specific hours and dedicating our 
            time to making our project the way we liked it to be.</p>
            <h4> Next Steps</h4>
            <p> The next steps I'll be taking are teaching myself how to better customize a webpage by adding more color properties and typography to adjust my webpage to look more appealing and attractive to the viewer's eyes. They say a 
                webpage's design is what hooks a reader, and the material inside it is what makes them keep reading. </p>
